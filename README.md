# Helios RewardingStub

# Project structure
This project has two main components:
* An android SDK
* A sample Android app

The android SDK is oriented to help integrating the Reward Module to an existing Android app. The sample app helps to see a way to use the SDK on a Kotlin based app.

## Android SDK
There is a main class called RewardingSdk that have all the methods needed to use the Rewarding Module API. There are also some callbacks that needs to be implemented in order to use those methods.

## Sample Android app
This is a simple kotlin app that shows a way to use the SDK. It is made up of activities and presenters.

# Library usage

## Prerequisites
* The app must be able to provide a user identifier and a context or use case identifier.
* The minimum android version is 9 (Pie)
* The app must grant the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission.
## Integration
To use the Rewarding SDK, you need to copy the `.aar` file into your app's library directory. 
Then, you need to add the following dependency to your app's gradle build file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation(name: 'helios-rewarding-sdk-debug', ext: 'aar')
}
```
Also, the app needs to apply some extra dependencies the SDK needs:  
```gradle
apply from: 'helios_rewarding_sdk.gradle'
```
This `helios_rewarding_sdk.gradle` is a file that needs to be placed into your app's gradle files.
The file contains the following code:  
```gradle
dependencies {
    def ktor_version = '1.3.1'
    def multiplatform_settings_version = "0.5"
    implementation "com.russhwolf:multiplatform-settings:$multiplatform_settings_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-client-android:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-client-gson:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-client-auth-jvm:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-client-logging-jvm:$ktor_version"
}
```
## Usage
The Rewarding SDK has seven methods to interact with: 
```kotlin
interface RewardingSdk {
    fun registerUser(userID: String, heliosContext: String, callback: RegisterUserCallback)
    fun getToken(callback: GetTokenCallback)
    fun removeToken(callback: RemoveTokenCallback)
    fun recordRewardableActivity(rewardableActivities: List<RewardableActivity>, callback: RecordRewardableActivityCallback)
    fun getCards(callback: GetCardsCallback)
    fun redeemCard(cardId: String, callback: RedeemCardCallback)
    fun cancel()
}
```
*  The `registerUser` method is the one that calls the `/auth/networkUser/register` Rewarding Module API method. It registers a user to the Rewarding Module using an identifyer an some context/use case identifyer. The response of the API method is an access token that the Rewarding SDK stores into the Sharedpreferences settings.
*  The `getToken` method reads the access token stored into the Sharedpreferences, if any.
*  The `removeToken` method removes the access token stored into the Sharedpreferences, if any.
*  The `recordRewardableActivity` method calls the `/activities/record` API method. It registers the activity of the user accepting a list of RewardableActivity objects.
*  The `getCards` method is used to call the `/cards` API method. It returns a list of available prepaid cards for the user.
* The `redeemCard` method calls the `/cards/redeemedCard` API method. It removes an existing prepaid card by the giving `cardId`.
*  The `cancel` method allows the app to stop any other running SDK process.  

Each one of this methods receive a callback object that needs to be implemented in order to manage the server response. Each callback is called by the `onSuccess` method when everything is OK and by the `onError` method when something go wrong.  
```kotlin
interface RegisterUserCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess()
}
```
> The `registerUser` does not return any data, because it stores the access token automatically.
```kotlin
interface GetTokenCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess(token: String)
}
```
> The `getToken` returns the access token as a String.
```kotlin
interface RemoveTokenCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess()
}
```
> The `removeToken` does not return any data.
```kotlin
interface RecordRewardableActivityCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess()
}
```
> The `recordRewardableActivity`does not return any data.
```kotlin
interface GetCardsCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess(cards: List<Card>)
}
```
> The `getCards` returns a collection of cards mapped by Card objects.
```kotlin
interface RedeemCardCallback {
    fun onError()
    fun onSuccess()
}
```
> The `redeemCard` does not return any data.

# Deepening

## Register user
| SDK method |
| ---------- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RewardingSdk.registerUser` |

| API method |
| ---------- |
| `/hrm-api/auth/networkUser/register` |

| SDK callback |
| ------------ |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RegisterUserCallback` |

| Model |
| ----- |
| None |

This method registers a user to the Rewarding Module using an identifyer an some context/use case identifyer. The response of the API method is an access token that the Rewarding SDK stores into the Sharedpreferences settings.

### Example of use
```kotlin
    fun registerUser(userID: String, context: String) {
        rewardingSdk.registerUser(userID, context, object: RegisterUserCallback {
            override fun onError() {
                view.showError("error")
            }

            override fun onSuccess() {
                view.showSuccess()
            }
        })
    }
```

## Record activity
| SDK method |
| ---------- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RewardingSdk.recordRewardableActivity` |

| API method |
| ---------- |
| `/hrm-api/activities/record` |

| SDK callback |
| ------------ |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RecordRewardableActivityCallback` |

| Model |
| ----- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.domain.model.RewardableActivity` |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.domain.Action` |

This method registers the activity of the user accepting a list of RewardableActivity objects.

### Example of use
```kotlin
    fun registerActivity(actions: List<Action>, date: String) {
        val rewardableActivities: MutableList<RewardableActivity> = mutableListOf()
        for (action in actions) {
            rewardableActivities.add(RewardableActivity(action = action.value, date = date))
        }
        rewardingSdk.recordRewardableActivity(rewardableActivities, object: RecordRewardableActivityCallback {
            override fun onError() {
                view.showError("error")
            }
            override fun onSuccess() {
                view.showSuccess()
            }
        })
    }
```
The `List<Action>` named `actions` is a collection of enumerable values of the `enum Action`. The `RewardableActivity` has two attributes: `action` and `date`. So you need to send to the API a list of predefined actions, each one with a date related to it.  
The list of available actions:  
```kotlin
enum class Action(val value: String) {
    ACTIVE_AD_HOC_NETWORK("actions_active-ad-hoc-network"),
    BROADCASTING("actions_broadcasting"),
    CODING("actions_coding"),
    COMMUNITY_INCREASES("actions_community-increases"),
    CONNECTION_ACCEPTED("actions_connection-accepted"),
    CONTENT_SHARING("actions_content-sharing"),
    DATA_FEED("actions_data-feed"),
    EARLY_ADOPTERS("actions_early-adopters"),
    HELIOS_ACTIVATION("actions_helios-activation"),
    HELIOS_LEARNING("actions_helios-learning"),
    HELIOS_TRACKING("actions_helios-tracking"),
    MEDIA_ARCHIVE_UPLOADING("actions_media-archive-uploading"),
    MEET_UP_EVENT("actions_meet-up-event"),
    NEW_FEATURE("actions_new-feature"),
    PERSONAL_PROFILE("actions_personal-profile"),
    PLATFORM_FEEDBACK("actions_platform-feedback"),
    PUBLIC_CHAT_FORUM("actions_public-chat-forum")
}
```

## Get cards
| SDK method |
| ---------- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RewardingSdk.getCards` |

| API method |
| ---------- |
| `/hrm-api/cards` |

| SDK callback |
| ------------ |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.GetCardsCallback` |

| Model |
| ----- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.domain.model.Card` |

This method returns a list of available prepaid cards for the user.

### Example of use
```kotlin
    fun getCards() {
        rewardingSdk.getCards(object: GetCardsCallback {
            override fun onError() {
                view.showError("error")
            }

            override fun onSuccess(cards: List<Card>) {
                view.showList(cards)
            }

        })
    }
```
The `onSuccess` callback method has a collection of Card objects as a parameter. Each `Card` has two attributes: `id` (the card identifyer) and `tokens` (the number of HLO of the reward).

## Redeem card
| SDK method |
| ---------- |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RewardingSdk.redeemCard` |

| API method |
| ---------- |
| `/hrm-api/cards/redeemedCard` |

| SDK callback |
| ------------ |
| `com.wordline.helios.rewarding.sdk.RedeemCardCallback` |

| Model |
| ----- |
| None |

This method removes an existing prepaid card from the database.

### Example of use
```kotlin
    fun redeemCard(cardId: String) {
        rewardingSdk.redeemCard(cardId, object: RedeemCardCallback {
            override fun onError() {
                view.showError("error")
            }

            override fun onSuccess() {
                getCards()
            }

        })
    }
```
In this example, the `onSuccess` callback method is used to refresh the list of available cards in the view.
